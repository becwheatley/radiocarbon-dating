This sample was taken from a hearth situated beneath the main concentration of artefacts and charcoal within this test pit. Overall about 160 artefacts were recovered dominated by quartz and quartzite. The assemblage included a small retouched silcrete flake, a quartzite flake with retouch and residues, and a horsehoof core. Some exotic materials (chalcedony) were evident and indicate transport from Cape Portland, some 10 km from the site.

Ultimately, some 760 auger and/or shovel pit probes were undertaken. The investigations identified incerasing volumes of shell dominated  by rock oyster (Saccostrea sp.) and mud whelk (Pyrazus sp.) - the latter being sourced from over 1 km from the site. Other species include conks, black periwinkles, turban and abalone. 32 holes contained bones all highly fragmented, some evidence of ringtail possum, macropod and fish bones were identifiable . 986 artefacts were recovered composed of 10 raw materials. A three fold increase in artefacts and a shift to quartz from silcrete and porphyritic volcanic stone was observed between older level B (30-60 cm) and upper level A (0-30cm). Level B was dominated by unmodified flakes with bipolar pieces being common in level A. Based on the cortex, artefacts appear to have been sourced from nearby pebble beds. This sample came from level D, which generally had poorly preserved shell. It was recovered from 30-40 cm and was tenatively considered as a basal date for the use of the area.",c14,,2979,,

W2,c.140,Radiocarbon,,Terrestrial,Open,Y,"Navin Officer Heritage Consultants Pty Ltd, 2003","An open site investigated as part of the installation of a sewerage system at Wombeyan Caves (at 600 m AHD). A test excavation of a surface scatter in association with alluvial terraces revealed deposits to 140cm. In one test pit, a buried palaesol between 120 and 140 cm below the surface retained an archaeological assemblage. This sample and Wk-11561 date the lower palaesol to the Terminal Pleistocene and suggest occupation of these uplands even in poorer climatic conditions. The excavations recovered 244 artefacts composed of eight different raw materials (only four of which were local). While only a small sample size, numbers of artefacts and retouched pieces were evident predominatly in the upper depths.",c14,,12178,,

These main two units were divided into seven soil units (the lower two being pre-Aboriginal arrival). The upper four units were late Holocene in origin (evident by this date from unit 3) and the lower units being early Holocene or late Pleistocene (based on accumulation and weathering rates). 72 artefacts were recovered and most of these were found in unit 5, which was considered to be early Holocene or late Pleistocene. Artefacts were composed of silcrete and indurated mudstone and composed primarily of unmodified flakes with occasional retouch. This sample comse from unit 3, which retained a few artefacts.",c14,,930,,

Archaeological material was found to depths dating to at least c.2.7ka and was generally within 5 - 20 m of the swamp's edge. Evidence of at least two burning phases (possible human) between 1500-1650 AD and at c.1.6ka were evident. Artefacts were Bondaian in nature throughout and indicate an earlier use of silcrete with a later preference for quartz. Artefact focus occurred in areas that were closer and more accessible to the water's edge. Highest artefact discard rates were located at c.1.6 ka.",c14,,2757,,

Data suggests initial use from XU 31 at c. 4.5ka (Wk-33541) with intermittent use from c. 4ka (Wk-32919) and peak activity between c. 0.7-0.3ka (Wk-33540-Wk-33542), with decline in use in uppermost deposits. Artefacts show changing use in material over time beginning with tuff, then chert and finally quartzite, the latter being associated with bifacial points. Faunal remains included turtle and fish species.",c14,,4525,,

Three test pits were dug primarily on the open plain in front of the rockshelter and totalling about 3 cubic metres (to a depth of 5ft). Some 20,000 artefacts were recovered within four distinct units, 1-4 (both sedimentologically and archaeologically). Unit 1 retained both Aboriginal and European artefacts. Unit 2 contained core tools and scrapers, flake adzes backed blades and pirri points, and retained the majority of the assemblage (>300 artefacts per cubic foot). Unit 3 contained core tool and scrapers, and backed blades only. Unit 4 retained core tool and scapers only, no backed blades. Artefacts were made from quartz, quartzite, silcrete and chert. Bone remains followed a similar pattern to the artefacts and included a range of kangaroos, small maruspials, lizards and emu eggshell. This sample came from unit 4 and predates the appearance of backed blades, pirri points and tula adzes at the site.",c14,,1850,,

Spits 6, 7 and 8 retained the most fish bone. Botancial remains include Pletrachne (tall tropical grasses which grow in arid regions) first, followed by Panicum  and Cyperaceae (perennial grasses) in the mid and upper section. Deciduous tree fruits, such as Terminalia and Celtis, and Ampeloscissus and Celtis (vine fruits) in the upper 9 spits.

The excavations identified four stratigraphic units: 1) a shallow dark brown clayey sand - modern disturbance zone; 2) the bulk of the site was composed of brownish yellow calcareous sand and contained the majority of the cultural deposits; 3) and 4) sand deposits, largely sterile. A wide range of bone was recovered, including Broad toothed rat, Long tailed rat, New Holland mouse and five species of kangaroo - some of this is from animals, with peak human activity in spits 15-28. Emu and eggshell were present. About 1,800 artefacts were recovered, dominated by topaz and quartz with some quartzite, limestone and silcrete. Sim summarised the site as follows: a low occupation during the Terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, with possible peak activity during the LGM; along with Beeton RS retained worked and retouched fossil shell artefacts, high percentage of quartz crystal flakes and cores, small amounts of ochre, scallop shell for ornament and food remains including extinct emu eggshell fragments and grey forester kangaroo bone.",c14,,20560,,

Above this (120-145 cm below surface) was sporadic evidence of human occupation, as well as extensive rock fall. Between 120 - 65 cm below surface, there is little evidence of human use, with the exception of a well-defined hearth at 85 cm below surface dated to c. 15 ka. The upper 65 cm of deposit consisted of a midden (between 50 - 65 cm) dating to between c. 4 and 8 ka and containing bone artefacts, then 25 cm of culturally sterile sand, then 25 cm of hearth and shell midden lenses. This sample dates the base of the midden. Bowdler (1984) indicates that some mis-labelling of the radiocarbon dates had occurred between ANU-1772 and ANU-1773; a further two dates ANU-1797 and ANU-1852 were undertaken to clarify this issue. Ultimately, it was concluded that ANU-1772 and ANU-1773 were correct, but in reverse order (i.e. spit 11 is c. 6 ka, while spit 13 is c. 14 ka).",c14,,14850,,

Site excavated by Lourandos. Basal date of site, few shells at this depth. Shell material dominated upper deposits dating to less than 450BP. The lower unit retained fragmented bone, stone artefacts and occasional marine shell (Plebidonax deltoides mainly). Lourandos' intepretation indicated the use of the site in the terminal Pleistocene as a sporadic hunting bivouc focussing on land mammals. This activity lasted into the early and mid Holocene (i.e. no hiatus). The late Holocene saw more intense use and a wider range of resources with increasing seasonal exploitation of marine and land resoures. Also discussed in a study by Bird & Frankel, 1991.

A hiatus appears to occur between Levels II and III. Artefacts were dominated by chert and did include numerous geometric microliths and backed blades.

The site was not completed in 1988 and a further 2 x 50 cm test pit to a depth of 152 cm was undertaken in 1989. The site is located on Weld River, 7 m above the river. The cave is 4 x 3 x 1.5 m in size with a large talus of deposit inside of the cave, as well as a small water channel.  They identified three stratigraphic units: the upper unit, 10-20 cm, composed of light brown cave earths and contained few stone tools and small bird, rodent and lizard bones - questionable whether a unit derived from human occupation or not; a middle unit (spit data suggests around 32.5 cm - 52.5 cm), composed of darker brown silty soils and contained grey ashy lenses, large quantites of stone flakes and animal bones (relatively unfragmented) - primarily larger marsupials; and a lower unit (spit data suggests around 52.5 cm - 74 cm) with blackened matrix (and dense in charcoal) and frequent hearths and contained similar finds to the middle unit, but they are more fragmented. Artefacts were primairly of quartzite from locally-derived material (within the cave), as well as other materials including Florentine, chalcedony, jasper, silcrete, hornfels, non-local quartzite, Mt Read volcanics and a fragment of Darwin glass (from an impact crater >100 km away).

A further five radiocarbon dates were obtained from horizon II - the only stratigraphic unit within the shelter containing cultural materials. These further results broadly agree with the earlier work, but suggest an earlier occupation of the site (pushing it into the LGM, rather than post LGM). Portch further re-classified horizon II into two units: Layer 1 dating from c. 20 - 14ka, and layer 2 dating to c.15 - 14ka (errors in the ages accounting for the overlap). Portch further identified a layer 3, which formed part of Stern and Marshall's horizon II and III; this layer contained hearths and was dated to c.15-10ka.

This sample was identified as 1436-3.",nonc14,,,,

Artefacts totalled 14 and were dominated by silcrete with some quartz and chert; technology was simple and indicated early reduction. The findings suggest a short ocucpation through the LGM with adaptions to severe climate stress. Abandonment of the site occurred shortly after, with some evidence of occupation in stratum 5 (a single chert flake) as early as 40ka.This sample comes from earlier geomorphology work on the lunette and agrees well with the archaeological record.",nonc14,,27310,,
